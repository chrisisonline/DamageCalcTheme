Chris's UI rehaul for the Pokemon Showdown Calculator!
=======================

The showdown calculator looks pretty outdated so I thought I would try to re-work the UI so it looks better and is easier to use!

Feel free to give me suggestions on what you think should be changed :D

###Changes:
* Header has been reworked so the buttons are larger, easier to press, and spaced out better.
* Header also has a custom made Vs logo
* Header is centered! (looks like it should have taken no time, but literally the longest section)
* Info fields had been re-orientated
* Whole site should be scalable between laptop & desktop monitors (1280px+)
* The + and - buttons make it easier to log pkm boosts (instead of having to use the dropdown menu)
* All elements are scalable :D

####Currently under-construction:
* Make the calculator mobile & tablet friendly (my main goal)
* Style the page so elements look more modern (less rounded edges)
* Possibly a dark theme (not sure)
* Add a health bar to show the calcs visually
* General tweaking

####Other tools used
* Sass
* Node.js

Hi Stephen,

I hope you've been doing well, it's hard to believe it's already been nearly a year since I worked with you guys!

I am actually looking for a 4 month co-op position starting from September (2016).
I realize it's a bit of short notice, but if you or any other managers are looking for a intern I would love to work at the Waterloo office once again. I am not looking for a specific position and I am flexible with my skills.

I would greatly appreciate it if you took some time to check out my updated resume. Its been completely redesigned and has all my recent accomplishments, including my personal website http://ChristopherisOnline.com. Since last year, I've actually built a much stronger portfolio in terms of web development. I've learned many of the most common front-end technologies and tools. Html, Css, Js, to name the basics and also Bootstrap, Node.js, Git, Angular.js, and some experience in MEAN stack. I've also expanded my abilities in UI/UX, user flows, and project development in my current position at American Express. Of course I would also be open to a support role such in IT or something similar to my previous position with your team.

Thanks in advance for taking your time to read this email. I look forward to hearing back from you, and maybe re-joining everyone for some more rounds of Wizard.

Regards,

Chris Jiang


Hey Ali,

I hope you've been doing well for the past few months!

I wanted to reach out to you since I am looking for a 4 month placement starting this September.
I realize its short notice, so I would equally appreciate it if you were able to forward my resume to a hiring manager if you have a full team at the RED lab. I am flexible to other roles and would be really thankful for your time and help.

I would greatly appreciate it if you took some time to check out my updated resume. Since last time we talked, I've actually built a stronger portfolio in terms of web development. I've learned many of the most common front-end technologies and tools. Bootstrap, Node.js, Git, Angular.js, and some experience in MEAN stack to name a few. I've also made great leaps regarding my abilities in UI/UX, user flows, and project development in my current position at American Express. I worked with their Digital Lab innovation team and practiced design sprints and rapid prototyping.

Thanks in advance, and would love to hear back from you soon!

Regards,

Chris
