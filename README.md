Chris's UI rehaul for the Pokemon Showdown Calculator!
=======================

The showdown calculator looks pretty outdated so I thought I would try to re-work the UI so it looks better and is easier to use!

Feel free to give me suggestions on what you think should be changed :D

###Changes:
* Header has been reworked so the buttons are larger, easier to press, and spaced out better.
* Header also has a custom made Vs logo
* Header is centered! (looks like it should have taken no time, but literally the longest section)
* Info fields had been re-orientated (not styled yet)
* Whole site should be scalable between laptop & desktop monitors (1280px+)

####Currently under-construction:
* Make the calculator mobile & tablet friendly (my main goal)
* Style the page so elements look more modern (less rounded edges)
* Possibly a dark theme (not sure)
* The + and - buttons will make it easier to log pkm boosts (instead of having to use the dropdown menu)
* Add a health bar to show the calcs visually
* General tweaking :D
